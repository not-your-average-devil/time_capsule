# ⏳ Time Capsule – Message Your Future Self

**A mindful Flutter app to store your thoughts, voice notes, and emotions for the future.**

Write a note or record a voice message and lock it away. It will only be available to your future self after a set date. Reflect, grow, and reconnect with who you were.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

We live fast. Too fast to pause and check in with ourselves.  
**Time Capsule** is a gentle interruption—an intentional space to preserve your thoughts and emotions and visit them later.
